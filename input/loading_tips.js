  'We only send your selection for Custom Ask; the surrounding text is read-only context.',
  'Grammar/Style runs strip the LaTeX preamble and map corrections back to the original positions.',
  'You can import structured JSON corrections to work fully offline.',
  'Use Undo after accepting/rejecting to restore the prior state and correction positions.',
  'Keyboard shortcuts: arrows to navigate, Enter to accept, Delete/Backspace to reject.',
  'Simplify works best on one–two paragraphs at a time; it returns three alternative rewrites with different lengths.',
  'Proof check is intended for a single theorem and its proof; select both together before running it.',
  'Custom / User Instructions let you define your own editing rule; you can set scope (selection vs full doc) and editing strength.',

  'You can paste JSON from ChatGPT into “Import Structured JSON” to visualize corrections without rerunning any model.',
  'Free-form reviewer comments can be pasted into “Import Comments” and turned into structured, clickable edits.',
  'The editor locks during a correction run; use Undo to restore the prior state and the full correction list.',
  'Model choice in the menu trades off quality and cost; open the browser console to see token usage and estimated price per run.',
  'LaTeX .tex files are supported: the preamble is stripped for analysis and corrections are mapped back to the original source.',
  'Session snapshots are stored locally; you can also save or load a full session as a .json file from the menu.'
